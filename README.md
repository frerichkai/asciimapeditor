# Roguelike map editor

A very simple editor for drawing ascii art maps for roguelike games on top of existing images.

## Usage

When started, a prompt for an image file will open. Select an image file you want to convert to ascii art.

* press a key on the keyboard to select a character.
* use the mouse with left button pressed to draw.
* right mouse button is for panning the map. 
* use the mouse wheel to zoom the map.
* middle mouse button flood-fills the area under the cursor with the current character. Beware of holes: there is no undo!
* save the map with CTRL+S
* load a previously saved map with CTRL+L

Feel free to use, copy and modify the code as much as you want.
